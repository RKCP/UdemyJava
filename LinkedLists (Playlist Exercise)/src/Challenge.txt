// Create a program that implements a playlist for songs
// Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist.
// The playlist is a linked list.
// Songs that we add will appear in the list in the order they were added.
// Once songs have been added to the playlist, you want to create a menu of options to add the below functionality:
//  - Quit out of the menu
//  - Skip forward to the next song
//  - Skip backwards to a previous song
//  - Replay the current song (consider what happens when you go back and forth without tracking the direction)
//  - List the songs in the playlist
//  - Remove the current song from the playlist. (hint: ListIterator.remove()

// A song MUST exist in the album, before it can be added to the playlist.






// Create a Song class which has the title and duration for the song.
// Songs are stored in albums, which are in turn stored in ArrayLists.
// A song MUST exist in the album, before it can be added to the playlist.

// Create an Album class which contains a list of songs.
// The actual albums will be stored in an ArrayList
